1.3.00 - 02-19-09 - Performed much code cleaning.
1.3.01 - 03-30-09 - BUG FIX - when uploading FULL file. If v_status column is left out, would re-activate deactivated items.
1.3.02 - 03-30-09 - BUG FIX - fixed blank manufactuers import where empty v_manufacturers_name when blank was not reset correctly
1.3.03 - 09-08-09 - Begins Major Code Revisions
1.3.03 Notes:
- Simplified ?langer=install and ?langer=remove  "langer" to "epinstaller", removed ?langer=installnew
- removed paypal request for donations!!
- no longer creates first export file
- changed logic of function ep_chmod_check() ... it now ONLY checks to see if the directory exist and is writeable and fails if either is not true.
  Also removed automatic attemps to chmod() throught this script - this is not secure.
09-15-09 - Decided to also split this mod off properly by adding TAB (like CSV and OSC)
09-29-09 - Created multiple exports for product attributes, option names, and option values
09-29-09 - updates Price/Qty/Breaks export code to use while statement. Now allow for unlimited in number of price breaks! 
10-01-09 - phazie's array definitions for filelayouts are more efficient and also more code readible and mod-able. array_merger() if very inefficient
           this required some tweaking in other places
         - found some places in the download code that I replace with exclusion code to speed up downloads. No sense executing code that wasn't needed.
         - export time in now in 24-hour:minute:second which makes better sense to me
10-02-09 - added metatags for products as in phazie's csv version - so far testing is good
10-05-09 - it is VERY important to have the correct delimiter set or the import of information will fail

1.3.04 - 10-13-09 - Fixed function call errors and added filtering check for UPC and UOM mods when downloading files
1.3.05 - 10-14-09 - Auto switching for file extention fixed dependant on delimitor <tab> or <comma>
                  - Somehow when adding a new item with empty manufacturer, it was being assigned the previously imported manufactures id. Spelling error in code!

4.0.00 - 12-21-09 - Begin Move to 4.0.000 beta
4.0.01 - 12-22-09 - Ha! Manufacturers weren't being created because I left off the "s" in manufacturers!
4.0.02 - 06-03-10 - changed all price_as to price_uom for unit of measure. This is a logical correction. Databases updated
                    ALTER TABLE products ADD products_upc VARCHAR(32) AFTER products_model;
                    ALTER TABLE products ADD products_price_uom VARCHAR(2) AFTER products_price;
4.0.03 - 11-19-2010 Fixed bug where v_date_avail (products_date_available) wasn't being set to NULL correctly.
4.0.04 - 11-22-2010 worked on quantity discount import code. now removes old discounts when discount type or number of discounts changes
4.0.05 - 11-23-2010 more work on quantity breaks. Eliminated the v_discount_id column since all discounts are entered at once fresh i'm just using loop index
         11-23-2010 added products_status to the Model/Price/Qty and Model/Price/Breaks
4.0.06 - 12-02-2010 added uninstall button on form page, removed unnecessary tables from form page
         12-02-2010 removed 'v_discount_id_' from export file layout - no longer needed
         12-02-2010 add EASYPOPULATE_4_CONFIG_MAX_QTY_DISCOUNTS variable to configuration page
4.0.07 - 12-02-2010 adding categories image, description and metadata export/import
         12-03-2010 completing Categories image/description/metadata export/import feature!
4.0.08 - 12-07-2010 found error: when uploading Model/Price/Qty to set Specials Pricing, quantity discounts are being wiped
4.0.09 - 12-10-2010 time to start breaking this down and using more functional design (and hopefully lead toward an OO based design)
         12-10-2010 move all file layout to functions now using $filelayout = ep_4_set_filelayout();
         12-11-2010 broke out all export code into easypopulate_4_export.php - This is included with a require_once() statement.
                    I am doing this so I can start to break this mod into more functional sections.
         12-13-2010 broke out all import code into easypopulate_4_import.php
         12-13-2010 moved these notes to easypopulate_4_changelog.php
         12-13-2010 changing the way categories are imported and exported. now using single column for categories where categories are separated
                    by a delimeter. Should allow "unlimited" category depth, but still a practical limit of 256 character for excel although
                    OpenOffice is not restricted. Multi-lingual categories should be achievable now.
         12-14-2010 beginning work on category import using single delimeted column 
         12-15-2010 export of mult-lingual categories is now working. Export/Import of "categorymeta" works correctly to assing multi-lingual values
                    Have not tested "full" import with multi-lingual categories. Must look closely at code. I may have to make the "full" import
                    only work with default language, and use 'categorymeta' for updating other languages. 
                    Why? Because error checking on import may become to onerous.
         12-16-2010 fixed small error in configuration keys where key was misspelled; removed all references to now defunct $max_categories
4.0.10 - 12-16-2010 Simple single-line attribute import code merged into EP4. Initial testing is good.
         12-21-2010 Auto checking of installed mods by checking if table columns exist, new fuction for checking table column, old one didn't work
4.0.11 - 03-09-2011 Removed EOREOR from export files, updated README with info about attribute importing, included example of Attrib-EP-xxx.CSV file.
         04-04-2011 Updated README.txt, added GPL license.txt file, added INSTALL.txt file. Replaced easypopulate_4_changelog.php with changelog.txt to avoid confusion.
4.0.12 - 11-04-2011 Fixed issue with export and import where legacy data may have NULL values set for manufacturers_id in the products table. This should be 0, but NULL was set in some earlier versions of EP.
4.0.13 - 11-08-2011 Fixed bug where meta tags statuses were being changed when doing an import such at PriceQty-EP. Needed to add meta tags statuses to $default_these[] in the import file.
                    Added support for custom products field products_gpc for google product category. For use with custom version of google merchant feeder.
4.0.14 - 11-09-2011 Some code enhancements and clean up.
         11-10-2011 Tentative fixes for multi-lingual stores. This codes builds entries in TABLE_CATEGORIES_DESCRIPTION for each language defined in the store, not just what's in the import file.
                    Have yet to properly process the additional languages at import. CategoryMeta does work, but the FULL import is not complete. Main issue: if the default language isn't "1" then the import script for
                    categories fails. This instead needs to cycle through each installed category, not start at "1".
         11-14-2011 BUG Fix: when importing a new manufacturer, the entry for each installed language for TABLE_MANUFACTURERS_INFO was not being created. If not created, this field is not editable within the admin. 
4.0.15 - 11-15-2011 Performance Boost: Added a quick fix for better performance on Import by adding a boolean variable $ep_feedback. If set to false, EP4 will skip most
                    reporting of new and updated products at end of script. This really saves on memory and execution time. All errors are still reported. 
         11-23-2011 More testing on performance of script. Export has been modified to ONLY export to the installed EP directory. This way I can write directly
                    to the export file rather than building a massive string to stream to client machine. This also conserves a great deal of memory.
                    This same "fix" should be implemented into the Import code which would require you to first upload the file, then execute the import from the
                    remote directory.
         12-05-2011 Some major changes. Changing the work flow per the note above. Added code to manage the CSV file on the remote machine. 
                    You now must first upload your EP file, then click the Import link to import. You can save exported file by right-clicking
                    their link and selecting "save-as". Is there another way to do this? This code needs a lot of clean-up and testing before 
                    submitting to github.
4.0.16 - 12-07-2011 Basic file management completed. Adding Split function for large data files. This will be executed first after uploading a large file.
                    Once file has been split, it can then be imported. This will also work for large files that have been exported... If you are using old ver
                    of Excel (with 65,000 rows limit) you can split your export file into smaller chunks. Langer had good forsight for file spitting, I just didn't
                    agree with his approach.
         12-08-2011 Split function seems to be working well. Need to add configuration variables to set the # of records to split on. 
                    I finally identified the problem with sites with MASSIVE data (like 100,000 on up products). It has to do with updating the price sorter:
                    After each import, Langer would call an update_prices script, and then also call zen_expire_specials if any specials were detected. However,
                    these scripts will time out on a server with very large databases. I am wondering what I am missing on import that I have to update ALL the pricing 
                    in one go instead of it being correct on each update.
         12-09-2011 Bug Fixed: manaufacturers_name length exceeds database field size 
                    Bug Fixed: wasn't checking length of category names. Now aborts that product's line if a category_name is too long
                    Updated: products_model length exceeds database file size (cleaned code related to this)
                    Added warnings to product_names and products_url lengths exceeded, but permitted adding/importing to catalog
                    I suppose mata-tags should also have this code (these are varchar 255).
         12-11-2011 More minor code clean-up. Will I ever finish? The import flow logic needs to be revisited... it's very "duck tape and bailing wire"
                    Pushing current code to github.     
4.0.17 - 12-15-2011 Added support for installing on Zencart 1.5.
         12-16-2011 BUG Fix: When importing multi-lingual file with missing language columns on a NEW product, additional laguage entries were not being created
                    in the TABLE_PRODUCTS_DESCRIPTION table.
         12-20-2011 BUG Fix: Multi-lingual category import was not working correctly. I believe I NOW have correctly solved this issue! (whoot!! whoot!!)
                    I wasn't sure I'd figure it out, and perhaps my solution is not the most efficient, but creating all entries at import for    
                    all your defined languages is working and quite an accomplishment. I do need to add some additional error trapping.
         12-21-2011 Error Trapping. So far, you MUST have a v_categories_name_1 to function correctly. Subsequent v_categories_?? definitions may be omitted. If omitted,
                    the missing column will be defaulted to v_categories_name_1.
         12-22-2011 Actually, v_categories_name_1 is not exact. You must have your lowest defined language. This is used as a "pivot" for adding other language entries.
                    This means that if you have more than one language define, and you add a new product (you need a category to do this) but do not define your additional
                    Language entries, that you have something to default to.
                    NOTE: Zencart "bug"? If you add a language, then later remove that language, the language entries are left in the databases!
         12-23-2011 Added rudimentary language support to Attributes Import. Basically, all languages are defaulted to the values
                    entered. No effort is made yet to define which is the default, they are just set the same. This step is being take to ensure that the 
                    required entries are properly being created so further updates or editing can be done.
4.0.18 - 01-27-2012 Added Improved handling for UTF8 Multi-Byte Characters for languages such as Greek. Should work for others but no data yet for testing Russian or Simplified Chineese
                    Added Configuration Variable EASYPOPULATE_4_CONFIG_CURLY_QUOTES with 3 options. 0-Don't Convert, 1-Convert to Basic Symbols, 2-Convert to HTML codes
                    Added support for products_msrp mod.
4.0.19 - 01-28-2012 Fixed bug in file splitting where subseqent splits appended to previously split files instead of overwritting them.
4.0.20 - 04-10-2012 Significant work on attributes import. Two Attribute Import/Export files are now available. Attrib-Basic-EP and Attrib-Detailed-EP.
                    Attrib-Basic-EP is used to create your products_options_name and products_options_values_name with a given product_options_type and assign 
                    this attribute set to a products_model. Multiple languages are supported. Important: You must have language id 1 (English by default install).
                    The Basic sheet can only create new attributes or update (add to) attributes for a given products_model. There is no provision yet for removing attributes
                    so this must be done from within the admin.
                    Attrib-Detailed-EP is used After you have imported your Basic attributes. The Detailed sheet can be used to update all vital settings for an attribute on a 
                    given products_model. Note that the Detailed sheet does NOT create products_options_name or products_options_values_name entries. NOR does the Detailed sheet
                    add or remove entries. 
                    The examples/ directory contains a new sample CSV file for importing attributes.
         04-12-2012 Added option to deal with character 0x92 (a right single quote) that appears to come from Western Europe (window 1252) encoding. This can also be corrected when
                    saving your CSV file and selecting either utf-8 or iso-8859-1. Added settings info on right side of screen.
                    NOTE: If \"" (which looks like an escape sequence) is in your input file, it will break the import. 
         04-13-2012 Expanded the filterable downloads to allow Complete Products, Model/Price/Qty, and Model/Price Breaks. Some minor changes to EP4 page.
         04-23-2012 Added configuration variables for MetaTags and Music Exports. If enabled, they allow for the additional columns to be exported.
         04-24-2012 Completed import/export for products_type = 2, Music (Artist, Record Company, Genre)
         04-25-2012 Concept for alternate column header names added to the import code. Needs fleshing out and a way for user interaction.
         04-30-2012 Added products_priced_by_attribute and product_is_always_free_shipping to the main products export/import file layout
		 05-01-2012 Added NEW file to support Featured Items export/import
         05-03-2012 Added "curly quotes" check for categories names import
         05-08-2012 More "curly quotes" checks added
4.0.21   06-01-2012	Fix to v_products_type on import.
                    Added new solution for checking database collation... this makes a difference when using 1.38/139 as the functions do not return field lengths correctly.
                    Fixed "security" issue with zencart 1.5
4.0.22 	 03-01-2014	SBA_Stock: Added functionality to manage total stock of items when Stock By Attributes (SBA) is installed and items are or are not tracked by SBA.
						Files modified: admin/easypopulate_4.php, easypopulate_4_import.php, easypopulate_4_export.php and admin/includes/functions/extra_functions/easypopulate_4_functions.php.
4.0.23 	 07-13-2014	Upgrade to ZC 1.5.3. Incorporated usage of mysqli_ related functions where mysql_ functions were used to continue functionality in older versions but allow
					continued operation in newer ZC versions.  Also added 
					additional SBA functionality for import and export.  SBA is 
					still tied to an older version of SBA and 
					needs to be updated to reflect Potterhouse's version.  Also
					modified the basic attribute process of updating the sort order
					to use a factor of 10 instead of a factor of 1 when importing
					basic attributes.  Ideally, the sort order would remain as
					previously assigned if the product existed and be adjusted as
					necessary to remain in the desired sort order; however, at 
					least this way room is provided between EP4 updates to add
					additional options between existing options.  
					In admin/easypopulate_4_attrib.php is a variable 
					$products_sort_order_increment that is currently set to 10 
					so that options will be added first at the value of 1 as 
					assigned in the same file, then will increment to 
					10, 20, 30, etc... for each subsequent option upon import 
					of the basic file.
